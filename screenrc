# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen. 
# A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate
# text buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap
# initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from the alternate
# text buffer. (The scrollbar also does not work when you start
# e.g. 'vi'). You can tell screen not to use these initialisations by
# adding the line
#  termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@ 
#    to your ~/.screenrc file.
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@

# set the number of lines to keep in the scroll buffer
defscrollback 5000
