# or had messages deleted, ie it does not update if only IMAP flags have
# changed.  Full updates need to fetch ALL flags for all messages, so
# this makes quite a performance difference (especially if syncing
# between two IMAP servers).
# Specify 0 for never, -1 for always (works even in non-autorefresh
# mode), or a positive integer <n> to do <n> quick updates before doing
# another full synchronization (requires autorefresh).  Updates are
# always performed after <autorefresh> minutes, be they quick or full.
